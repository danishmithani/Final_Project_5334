Link to github : https://github.com/danishmithani/Final_Project_5334/
Link to Proposal : 
Link to Video : 
Link to Read More about model creation : 

The file was hosted on Local Host Anaconda Navigator.

Not being the best at github myself, i may use simple terminologies to explain the steps for execution of index.py file. There may be alternate ways but this is how i executed 

Step 1: Download the Project folder " Final_Project_5334 " say on desktop.
step 2: Open Anaconda Navigator. Go to Anaconda command promt to run commands:
      pip install streamlit
Step 3: now go back to the Project folder saved by you on desktop. Open command prompt there using : cd "C:/Desktop/Final_Projct_5334" on CMD
Step 4: run the following command : streamlit run index.py
you app will automatically open on a browser
